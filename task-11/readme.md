I made this poster on canva.com , it consist of five words . The meaning is soo deep , future lies in uncertainty implies that I am a person who loves to live in present !
And we can never know a person fully . We are right now living in the world of huge uncertainties but what keeps every human being going is Hope ( which is very powerful).
This image is a screenshot that I took few months back ,rest I edited in canvas.com
