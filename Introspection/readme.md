Why must we choose you?

Hey! I am Divya Bisht . I am a very curious person and like to learn new stuff , explore and will try to innovate things.I literally very keen on learning new technological thing , coding , web development and want to be part of something big by helping people in small ways by contributing and enhance there projects .I am a good listener and love working in a team .I believe if there is a problem we should solve it , give our best ! I am a beginner but i'm sure we all have to start somewhere! so please give me a chance.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Learn and grow as a person ! I want to get in FOSS club and learn things ! And really looking forward for getting to figure out all development related stuff  and will start contributing to open source.I believe anyone can do anything if they put their mind into it !

How would you contribute back to the club?

In every possible way ! The school i attended have the motto : We learn to Serve  so it's pretty much inculcated in us to be selfless and help world be a better place. Plus we learn so much more by helping people .

Do you have any feedback for selection process?

The selection process helps us know about a lot of things . IRC I just have seen some in mr.robot series but really exploring the internet is so fun .
I am just noob person trying to figure stuff out !
